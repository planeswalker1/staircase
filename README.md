## Description

_This repository has been created in order to showcase a programming challenge about looping completed in JavaScript._

## challenge

Consider a staircase of size _n_ = 5:

```
    #
   ##
  ###
 ####
#####
```

Observe that its base and height are both equal to _n_, and the image is drawn using # symbols and spaces. The last line is not preceded by any spaces.

Write a program that prints a staircase of size _n_.

**Function Description**

Complete the staircase function in the editor below. It should print a staircase as described above.

staircase has the following parameter(s):

n: an integer

**Input Format**

A single integer, _n_, denoting the size of the staircase.

**Constraints**

_0_ < _n_ <= 100.

**Output Format**

Print a staircase of size _n_ using # symbols and spaces.

**Note**: The last line must have 0 spaces in it.

**Sample Input**

```
6
```

**Sample Output**

```
     #
    ##
   ###
  ####
 #####
######
```

**Explanation**

The staircase is right-aligned, composed of # symbols and spaces, and has a height and width of _n_ = 6.
